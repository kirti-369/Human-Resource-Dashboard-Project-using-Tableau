Human Resource Dashboard(Tableau Project)
Developed a comprehensive Human Resource Dashboard in Tableau, showcasing advanced data visualization techniques to facilitate data-driven decision-making. The process involved several key steps:

**Building the Data Source:**
Collected and connected data from multiple sources.
Built a data model and checked data quality and data types.
Understood and explored the data to ensure accuracy and relevance.

**Building Charts:**
Analyzed requirements to determine the appropriate visualizations.
Created calculated fields to derive meaningful metrics.
Built and formatted charts to ensure clarity and effectiveness.

**Building Dashboards:**
Planned the dashboard layout and structure.
Created a container structure to organize the charts and visual elements.
Utilized data blending, parameter controls, table calculations, dual-axis charts, and geospatial mapping to enhance functionality and interactivity.

**Techniques used are:**
  1) Calculated Fields: Created custom calculations to derive meaningful metrics and KPIs, enhancing the analytical depth.
  2) Parameter Controls: Implemented dynamic parameter controls allowing users to interact with and filter data views.
  3) Table Calculations: Applied advanced table calculations to provide running totals, moving averages, and year-over-year growth analysis.
  4) Dual-axis Charts: Designed dual-axis charts for comparative analysis, merging different types of data visualizations in a single view.
  5) Dashboard Actions: Configured actions such as filters, highlights, and URL actions to enable smooth navigation and interactivity within the dashboard.
  6) Custom Formatting: Applied custom formatting and design elements to ensure clarity and aesthetic appeal.
  7) Geospatial Mapping: Utilized geospatial mapping techniques to visualize location-based HR data, such as employee distribution and regional performance.
